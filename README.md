This Python code is a Loan Calculator that can compute various loan-related parameters depending on user input provided through command-line arguments. It supports two types of payments: annuity (fixed monthly payments) and differentiated (payments decrease over time).

Key Features:
Annuity Calculations:

Compute the number of months needed to repay a loan.

Calculate monthly payment amount.

Determine the loan principal.

Display the total overpayment made on the loan.

Differentiated Payments:

Calculates a separate payment for each month.

Outputs each month's payment and total overpayment.

Interest Handling:

All interest values are expected as annual percentage rates and are converted to monthly rates in the calculations.

Validation:

The validate_args function ensures correct parameter combinations and input ranges.

User Interface:

Uses the argparse module to parse command-line arguments like --type, --principal, --payment, --periods, and --interest.

This tool is useful for anyone needing quick loan estimations for planning or financial analysis.
